# PlayerMovement

How should our player move? How should the world look/feel through their eyes?
How does gravity affect our player??

- First Person or Third Person? || both? (toggle with keybind)
- Abillity to crouch? 
- Abillity to prone?
- how high can they jump/Can they double jump?
- Will the player be able to sprint??

### Some other things we should consider are whether or not the player will be able to move in any special ways via abillities/skills for example flight or a "blink abillity"
